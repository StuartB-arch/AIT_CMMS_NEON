# DUPLICATE PM GENERATION - FIXES IMPLEMENTED

## Date: October 28, 2025

---

## CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### Fix #1: Check for Uncompleted Schedules from Previous Weeks ✅

**Location:** `PMEligibilityChecker.check_eligibility()` - Lines 303-313

**What was fixed:**
- Added new method `CompletionRecordRepository.get_uncompleted_schedules()` (Lines 233-261)
- Checks if equipment is already scheduled in a PREVIOUS week with status='Scheduled'
- If found, returns CONFLICTED status with message showing which week it's already scheduled for

**Impact:**
- Equipment will NOT be scheduled multiple times
- If scheduled in week 1 but not completed, it will NOT be scheduled again in week 2
- Prevents the massive backlog of duplicate schedules

**Example:**
```
BFM 20243323 scheduled for week 9/22 (uncompleted)
Week 9/29 generation: SKIPPED (already scheduled for 9/22)
Week 10/13 generation: SKIPPED (already scheduled for 9/22)
```

### Fix #2: Load Scheduled PMs BEFORE Deletion ✅

**Location:** `PMSchedulingService.generate_weekly_schedule()` - Lines 720-730

**What was fixed:**
- Moved `bulk_load_scheduled()` call to BEFORE the DELETE statement
- This ensures the scheduled PM cache is populated BEFORE deletion
- Makes the "already scheduled" check effective

**Before (buggy):**
```python
DELETE FROM weekly_pm_schedules  # Deletes first
bulk_load_scheduled()           # Loads empty cache
check if already scheduled      # Always returns false!
```

**After (fixed):**
```python
bulk_load_scheduled()           # Loads cache with existing schedules
DELETE FROM weekly_pm_schedules  # Then deletes
check if already scheduled      # Works correctly now
```

---

### Fix #3: Warn Before Deleting Schedules with Completions ✅

**Location:** `PMSchedulingService.generate_weekly_schedule()` - Lines 711-718

**What was fixed:**
- Added `check_week_has_completions()` method to CompletionRecordRepository (Lines 263-273)
- Checks if week already has completed PMs BEFORE deletion
- Logs WARNING if regenerating a week with completions

**Impact:**
- User is warned if they're about to delete completed PM records
- Prevents accidental data loss
- In production, this should show a confirmation dialog

**Example output:**
```
WARNING: Week 2025-10-20 already has 15 completed PMs
WARNING: Regenerating will DELETE these completion records!
```

---

### Fix #4: Enhanced Validation and Logging ✅

**What was fixed:**
- Added detailed debug logging throughout the PM generation process
- Validates equipment supports PM type (has_monthly, has_annual)
- Validates equipment is not in cannot_find_assets or run_to_failure_assets

**Impact:**
- Better visibility into what the system is doing
- Easier debugging of PM generation issues
- Clear audit trail of decisions

---

## BUSINESS RULES ENFORCED

### 1. No Duplicate Scheduling ✅
- Equipment can only have ONE active schedule per PM type at a time
- If scheduled but not completed, will NOT be scheduled again

### 2. Minimum Intervals Enforced ✅
- Monthly PM: Minimum 30 days between completions
- Annual PM: Minimum 365 days between completions
- Cross-PM conflicts: Can't schedule Annual within 7 days of Monthly

### 3. CANNOT FINDS Excluded ✅
- Equipment with status='Missing' excluded from scheduling
- Equipment in cannot_find_assets table excluded

### 4. Run to Failure Excluded ✅
- Equipment with status='Run to Failure' excluded from scheduling
- Equipment in run_to_failure_assets table excluded

### 5. PM Type Validation ✅
- Only schedule Monthly PM if equipment.monthly_pm = 1
- Only schedule Annual PM if equipment.annual_pm = 1

### 6. P1/P2/P3 Priority Scheduling ✅
- P1 assets scheduled first (priority = 1)
- P2 assets scheduled second (priority = 2)
- P3 assets scheduled third (priority = 3)
- All other assets scheduled last (priority = 99)
- Within each priority level, sorted by days overdue (most overdue first)

---

## BUSINESS RULE QUESTION FOR USER

### P1/P2/P3 Gating Rule

**User stated:** "Then generate pms for the rest of the assets IF P1,P2,P3 monthly and annuals have been completed."

**Current behavior:**
- System PRIORITIZES P1/P2/P3 first
- But still schedules non-priority assets in the same week

**Question:** Did you mean:
1. **PRIORITIZE** P1/P2/P3 (already implemented) - OR -
2. **GATE** non-priority assets (don't schedule them at all until ALL P1/P2/P3 monthly AND annuals are completed)

**Gating would mean:**
- If ANY P1/P2/P3 equipment has uncompleted monthly or annual PM
- Then NO non-priority assets get scheduled
- This seems very restrictive

**Please clarify which behavior you want:**
- [ ] Prioritization only (current behavior)
- [ ] Gating rule (need to implement)

## HOW TO TEST THE FIXES

### Test 1: No Duplicate Scheduling
```python
# Week 1: Schedule BFM 20243323
# Don't complete it
# Week 2: Generate schedule
# EXPECTED: BFM 20243323 NOT scheduled again
# ACTUAL: Will show "Already scheduled for week [week1] (uncompleted)"
```

### Test 2: Completed PMs Not Rescheduled Too Soon
```python
# Complete BFM 20251152 Monthly PM on 2025-10-22
# Generate schedule for week 2025-10-27 (5 days later)
# EXPECTED: BFM 20251152 NOT scheduled (< 30 days)
# ACTUAL: Will show "Monthly PM completed 5 days ago (min interval: 30)"
```

### Test 3: Warning on Regeneration
```python
# Generate schedule for week 2025-10-20 (already has completions)
# EXPECTED: Warning logged
# ACTUAL: "WARNING: Week 2025-10-20 already has 15 completed PMs"
```

### Test 4: Priority Sorting
```python
# Generate schedule
# EXPECTED: P1 equipment first, then P2, then P3, then others
# ACTUAL: Check the generated assignments list
```

## FILES MODIFIED

1. **AIT_CMMS_REV3.py**
   - Lines 233-273: Added new methods to CompletionRecordRepository
   - Lines 303-313: Added uncompleted schedule check to PMEligibilityChecker

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **TEST** the fixes:
   - Clean up existing duplicate schedules from database
   - Generate new schedule for current week
   - Verify no duplicates created
   - Verify proper prioritization

2. **CLARIFY** P1/P2/P3 gating rule:
   - Get confirmation from user
   - Implement if needed

3. **MONITOR** in production:
   - Watch for any duplicate schedules
   - Check warning logs
   - Verify completion data integrity

4. **COMMIT** and push changes to repository

---

## DATABASE CLEANUP QUERY (if needed)

To clean up existing duplicate schedules:

```sql
-- Find duplicates
SELECT bfm_equipment_no, pm_type, COUNT(*) as count, 
       GROUP_CONCAT(week_start_date) as weeks
FROM weekly_pm_schedules
WHERE status = 'Scheduled'
GROUP BY bfm_equipment_no, pm_type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Delete older duplicates, keep most recent schedule
DELETE FROM weekly_pm_schedules
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MAX(id)
    FROM weekly_pm_schedules
    WHERE status = 'Scheduled'
    GROUP BY bfm_equipment_no, pm_type
);
```

## SUMMARY

The duplicate PM generation issue has been **RESOLVED** with 4 critical fixes:

1. ✅ Check for uncompleted schedules from previous weeks
2. ✅ Load scheduled PMs before deletion
3. ✅ Warn before deleting weeks with completions
4. ✅ Enhanced validation and logging

The system will now:
- Prevent duplicate scheduling
- Respect minimum intervals
- Prioritize P1/P2/P3 equipment
- Exclude CANNOT FINDS and Run to Failure equipment
- Provide clear warnings and audit trail

**Status:** Ready for testing and deployment
